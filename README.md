# FoodScan
FoodScan is an app designed to assist individuals with food alergies in making safe and informed choices when purchasing packaged foods. The app aims to provide instant information about potential allergens present in the scanned product, helping users avoid allergenic ingredients and reduce the risk of adverse reactions.
I will be using this project to learn Flutter and Dart
